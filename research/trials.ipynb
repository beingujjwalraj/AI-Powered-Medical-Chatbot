      "Assistant: Whale blood tests are not typically performed in the same way as human blood tests due to the size and species of whales. However, blood samples can be obtained from whales for various purposes, such as research or health assessment. This is usually done by taking a small sample from a live whale using a biopsy dart gun or a pole syringe, or from a dead whale during a necropsy. The specific procedures and precautions for collecting whale blood samples may vary depending on the species and the specific research or health assessment goals.\n"
